    Hello, my name is Sloan Pardo. I am a senior in engineering school, working towards a major in Information Technology. 
    I also have a certificate in cybersecurity and a minor in art. I started coding in 2017 as a junior in high school. 
    I have worked with multiple different languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C#, C, C++, and swift. 
    I am also familiar with HTML and CSS; web design is a big reason I pursued a degree in Information technology in the first place. 
    Though I am familiar with material we are learning in the class I needed a couple extra credits to graduate and believe I will 
    still learn new things. I thought it would be great to be able to make a portfolio of all my work throughout college, which I can 
    then use after I graduate and am looking for jobs. Outside of school I like to hangout with friends and family. I am also super 
    creative and always like to have a project. Most of the time you can find me making bracelets or working on some sort of art.
