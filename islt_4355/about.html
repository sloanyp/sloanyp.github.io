        <h2>About Me:</h2>
        <p>
            I am a 5th year senior in Mizzouâ€™s Engineering school. 
            Prior to college I graduated from an all-girls high school in St. Louis, St. Josephs Academy. 
            This is where my interest in technology blossomed. I began my first web design course as a junior in 2016. Moving on to college, it is important for 
            me to be involved in art. Leading me to choose Digital Story Telling as my major. 
            After starting classes I realize that something is missing and that I am not happy with my decision.
            I then take a leap of faith, deciding to change my major. 
            I want a challenge that I can also make a career out of. Today, my major is Information Technology. 
            I have a certification in cybersecurity as well as a minor in art. 
            I plan to graduate from the University of Missouri in May 2023.
