    <h3>About Me:</h3>
    <p>
        Hello, my name is Sloan Pardo. I am a 5th year senior in Mizzouâ€™s Engineering school. 
        Prior to college I graduated from an all-girls high school in St. Louis, St. Josephs Academy. 
        This is where my interest in technology blossomed. <br>
        I began my first web design course as a <em>junior</em> in 2016. Moving on to college, it is important for 
        me to be involved in art. Leading me to choose Digital Story Telling as my major. 
        After starting classes I realize that something is missing and that I am not happy with my decision.
        I then take a leap of faith, deciding to change my major. 
        I want a challenge that I can also make a career out of. Today, my major is <em>Information Technology</em>. 
        I have a certification in cybersecurity as well as a minor in art. 
        I plan to graduate from the University of Missouri in May 2023.
