                <p class="firstLetter">Since switching from digital storytelling to Computer Science and finally to Information 
                    Technology I have found my place. Starting out in digital story telling I knew right after the first 
                    class that I wanted to be more involved with math and coding. So, I switched to computer 
                    science. I enjoyed these classes but covid had just hit. Keeping up with the required schoolwork 
                    seemed impossible. As I tried to integrate a new way of living with my studies, I found that 
                    Information technology was a better fit for me. The two were very similar, sharing many cross-
                    listed courses. The biggest difference for me was the teachers, in my computer science classes 
                    there was so much stress and pressure put on tiny assignments. I felt like I was in over my head, 
                    until I switched to Information technology. We were learning the same things, but everything 
                    seemed to make sense and the teachers were more than willing to help.
                </p>
                <p class="indent">The classes are fast paced, and jam packed with useful skills. I have experience in using html, 
                    css, Java, JavaScript, Python, PHP, C#, C, C++, and swift. I know how to query a database and 
                    set one up. I’m familiar with mongoDB, mySQL, and MariaDB.  I can design a website and code 
                    it from top to bottom. I have a basic understanding of how to create IOS applications in Xcode. 
                    I’ve used GitHub to work collaboratively. I am comfortable using Windows or macOS file 
                    systems. I have also used many adobe applications such as After Effects, Photoshop, Audition, 
                    Illustrator, and Premiere Pro. These examples are just scratching the surface of everything I got 
                    to experience working with throughout the program.  
                </p>
                <p class="indent">
                    Over the semesters I have been lucky enough to gain knowledge in many different subjects in 
                    addition to Information Technology. Getting a certification in Cyber Security as well as a minor 
                    in art. I wanted to get the most out of my college education and believe that adding these two 
                    would only enhance my chances of receiving a job right after graduation. Art has always been a 
                    passion of mine. Adding my art minor allowed me to get experience in using online software that 
                    may be necessary for a tech job. I also received a ton of insight on layout, color schemes, and a 
                    plethora of other design principles. These skills give me an extra edge while creating apps and 
                    websites. Cyber Security is a no brainer. I have worked with Wireshark, password cracking tools, 
                    virtual environments, VMWare, IP addresses, the command line, Maltego, Docker, AWS and so 
                    much more.

                    Most of the time in this major I was forced to go outside of my comfort zone. Typically, I am 
                    one of a couple females, if not the only woman in my classes. I am always up for a challenge and 
                    enjoy working my hardest to represent women in STEM. I have done so by out doing myself 
                    time and time again and making the dean’s list. The engineering school at Mizzou has 
                    thoroughly prepared me for what’s to come. I am excited to graduate and see where my next 
                    journey will begin.  </p>
