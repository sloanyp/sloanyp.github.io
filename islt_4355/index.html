            I am so happy you stopped by! 
            My name is Sloan Pardo, here you will get a glimpse into my Information Technology journey. 
            Whether you are a future employer or would just like to see what I have been up to for the past five 
            years you are in the right place. I hope to portray a wide variety of all my skills, 
            that will ultimately land me a job in the field of my dreams. 
            The hard work and dedication have paid off. I am excited to share a bit about myself, my projects, 
            skills, and reflection of my experiences. Feel free to reach out or get in contact 
            with me by navigating to the contact page. Please enjoy!
